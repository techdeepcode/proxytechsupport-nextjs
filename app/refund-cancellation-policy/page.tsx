      intro="This Refund and Cancellation Policy applies to paid services provided by Proxy Tech Support. Please review this policy before making payment."
    >
      <p>
        Our services require advance evaluation, communication, specialist allocation, scheduling,
        preparation and reservation of professional time. For this reason, payments are generally final
        and non-refundable once accepted or once service-related work or resource allocation has begun.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing in this policy limits any right that cannot legally be excluded under applicable law.</p>

      <h2>1. Scope Confirmation Before Payment</h2>
      <p>Before accepting payment, we aim to explain or confirm the relevant:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Service requested</li>
        <li>Service scope</li>
        <li>Delivery method</li>
        <li>Support period or session duration</li>
        <li>Customer responsibilities</li>
        <li>Applicable limitations</li>
        <li>Fee</li>
        <li>Scheduling expectations</li>
        <li>Refund and cancellation terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Customers are responsible for asking questions and confirming that they understand the service before making payment.</p>
      <p>Payment indicates acceptance of the communicated service scope and this policy.</p>

      <h2>2. General Non-Refundable Rule</h2>
      <p>Payments are non-refundable once:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The service has been confirmed</li>
        <li>A specialist or team member has been assigned</li>
        <li>Time has been reserved</li>
        <li>A session has been scheduled</li>
        <li>Documents have been received for review</li>
        <li>Research, analysis or preparation has begun</li>
        <li>A resume, profile, plan, answer, code, document or deliverable has been worked on</li>
        <li>Technical-support activity has begun</li>
        <li>Interview or job-support requirements have been analysed</li>
        <li>A support channel or service period has been activated</li>
        <li>Any part of the agreed service has been delivered</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This applies even when the customer later:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changes their mind</li>
        <li>No longer requires the service</li>
        <li>Changes role, technology or employer</li>
        <li>Cancels an interview</li>
        <li>Has an interview cancelled by an employer</li>
        <li>Receives no recruiter response</li>
        <li>Is not selected</li>
        <li>Does not obtain employment</li>
        <li>Does not achieve an expected salary</li>
        <li>Does not use all available support</li>
        <li>Stops responding</li>
        <li>Is unavailable</li>
        <li>Chooses another provider</li>
        <li>Is dissatisfied with an employment outcome controlled by a third party</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Payments are made for the agreed support effort, reserved capacity and service delivery&mdash;not
        for a guaranteed employment result.
      </p>

      <h2>3. No Outcome-Based Refunds</h2>
      <p>Refunds will not be provided solely because a customer does not receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An interview invitation</li>
        <li>A recruiter response</li>
        <li>Interview selection</li>
        <li>A job offer</li>
        <li>Employment</li>
        <li>A promotion</li>
        <li>A salary increase</li>
        <li>A particular compensation package</li>
        <li>Continued employment</li>
        <li>A desired project or workplace outcome</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Proxy Tech Support does not control employers, recruiters, interviewers, clients or third-party
        platforms and does not guarantee these outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Services Requiring Advance Preparation</h2>
      <p>Certain services require work before the scheduled interaction, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reviewing a job description</li>
        <li>Reviewing a resume or profile</li>
        <li>Evaluating technical requirements</li>
        <li>Assigning a suitable specialist</li>
        <li>Preparing relevant material</li>
        <li>Researching technology or project context</li>
        <li>Reserving interview or support availability</li>
        <li>Planning profile or application activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once this preparation or allocation begins, the associated payment is non-refundable, even when
        the live session or later activity has not yet occurred.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Cancellation by the Customer</h2>
      <p>A customer may request cancellation by contacting us in writing.</p>
      <p>Submitting a cancellation request does not automatically create refund eligibility.</p>
      <p>
        Where no work has started, no time has been reserved and no resource has been committed, we may
        review the request individually. Any refund, partial refund or credit in such a situation is
        discretionary unless otherwise required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>Once the service has commenced or resources have been committed, cancellation does not result in a refund.</p>

      <h2>6. Rescheduling</h2>
      <p>Where practical, we may permit rescheduling instead of cancellation.</p>
      <p>Rescheduling is subject to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reasonable advance notice</li>
        <li>Specialist availability</li>
        <li>Nature of the service</li>
        <li>Work already completed</li>
        <li>Number of earlier rescheduling requests</li>
        <li>The agreed service period</li>
        <li>Urgency and timing of the original request</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Repeated, last-minute or same-day rescheduling requests may be declined.</p>
      <p>Approval of one rescheduling request does not create a right to future rescheduling.</p>

      <h2>7. Missed Sessions and No-Shows</h2>
      <p>A scheduled session may be treated as delivered and non-refundable where the customer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not attend</li>
        <li>Is materially late</li>
        <li>Cannot be contacted</li>
        <li>Does not provide required access or information</li>
        <li>Has an internet, device or account problem under their control</li>
        <li>Cancels without sufficient notice</li>
        <li>Becomes unavailable after a specialist has reserved the time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At our discretion and subject to availability, we may offer one replacement session or service
        credit. This is a goodwill option and not an automatic entitlement.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Customer Delays and Unused Service Time</h2>
      <p>A customer&rsquo;s delay, inactivity or failure to respond does not automatically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pause the service period</li>
        <li>Extend the service period</li>
        <li>Create refund eligibility</li>
        <li>Transfer the service to another person</li>
        <li>Convert unused support into cash</li>
        <li>Carry unused time forward indefinitely</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any extension or credit must be expressly approved in writing.</p>

      <h2>9. Scope Changes</h2>
      <p>A request to change the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Role</li>
        <li>Technology</li>
        <li>Interview</li>
        <li>Project</li>
        <li>Service type</li>
        <li>Support level</li>
        <li>Delivery date</li>
        <li>Specialist requirement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>after payment may be treated as a new or revised scope.</p>
      <p>We may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accept the change without additional cost</li>
        <li>Adjust the delivery schedule</li>
        <li>Apply an additional fee</li>
        <li>Offer service credit</li>
        <li>Decline the revised request</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A customer-requested scope change does not automatically qualify for a refund.</p>

      <h2>10. Circumstances in Which a Refund May Be Considered</h2>
      <p>A refund or correction may be considered where:</p>

      <h3>Duplicate payment</h3>
      <p>The same invoice or service was unintentionally paid more than once.</p>
      <p>The duplicate amount may be refunded after payment verification.</p>

      <h3>Incorrect payment amount</h3>
      <p>A clearly identifiable excess payment was made due to a payment-processing error.</p>

      <h3>Cancellation by Proxy Tech Support</h3>
      <p>We cancel the paid service and cannot provide a reasonable replacement, rescheduling option or equivalent service credit.</p>

      <h3>Service not commenced</h3>
      <p>
        No preparation, scheduling, specialist allocation, document review, support activation or
        delivery has occurred, and we approve the cancellation request.
      </p>

      <h3>Material non-delivery</h3>
      <p>
        The agreed paid service was not materially delivered due solely to our failure, and we cannot
        reasonably correct, complete, replace or reschedule it.
      </p>

      <h3>Legal requirement</h3>
      <p>A refund is required under applicable law or by a binding order from a competent authority.</p>

      <p>
        Where only part of a service remains undelivered, any approved refund may be limited to the
        genuinely undelivered portion after accounting for completed work, preparation, reserved time and
        non-recoverable payment charges, where legally permissible.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Service Concerns and Correction Opportunity</h2>
      <p>Before requesting a refund for an alleged service issue, customers should provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their name</li>
        <li>Payment reference</li>
        <li>Service purchased</li>
        <li>Date of payment</li>
        <li>Description of the concern</li>
        <li>Relevant supporting information</li>
        <li>The requested resolution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where reasonably possible, we should first be given an opportunity to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarify the scope</li>
        <li>Correct an error</li>
        <li>Complete an omitted deliverable</li>
        <li>Replace defective work</li>
        <li>Reschedule the service</li>
        <li>Assign another suitable resource</li>
        <li>Offer a reasonable service credit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A subjective preference or dissatisfaction that can reasonably be corrected does not automatically require a cash refund.</p>

      <h2>12. Non-Refundable Completed and Digital Work</h2>
      <p>The following are generally non-refundable once supplied, shared, reviewed or substantially prepared:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resume or profile work</li>
        <li>Written answers</li>
        <li>Interview questions</li>
        <li>Technical documents</li>
        <li>Code or technical guidance</li>
        <li>Architecture or project analysis</li>
        <li>Recorded or live sessions</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Templates</li>
        <li>Plans</li>
        <li>Reports</li>
        <li>Profile-marketing work</li>
        <li>Application-related work</li>
        <li>Communication support</li>
        <li>Specialist time</li>
        <li>Customised digital deliverables</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is because customised work and reserved professional time cannot ordinarily be returned or reused as an untouched product.</p>

      <h2>13. Policy Violations and Customer Misconduct</h2>
      <p>No refund will ordinarily be provided where service is refused, suspended or terminated because the customer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requests unlawful activity</li>
        <li>Requests impersonation</li>
        <li>Provides materially false information</li>
        <li>Uses fraudulent or fabricated documents</li>
        <li>Requests unauthorised access</li>
        <li>Violates employer or platform rules</li>
        <li>Abuses, threatens or harasses team members</li>
        <li>Misuses confidential information</li>
        <li>Materially breaches the Terms of Service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This does not affect any right that cannot legally be excluded.</p>

      <h2>14. Payment Gateway and Bank Charges</h2>
      <p>Where a refund is approved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment-gateway charges may be non-recoverable</li>
        <li>Bank or international-transfer charges may apply</li>
        <li>Currency-conversion differences may occur</li>
        <li>Processing time may depend on the bank or payment provider</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any deduction will be made only where legally permissible and transparently communicated.</p>

      <h2>15. Refund Request Timeframe</h2>
      <p>
        A refund-related concern should be submitted promptly and, where possible, within seven calendar
        days of the relevant payment or service issue.
      </p>
      <p>Submitting a request within this period does not guarantee approval.</p>
      <p>
        Requests concerning duplicate payments or issues recognised later under applicable law will be
        handled according to the circumstances and legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>16. How to Submit a Request</h2>
      <p>Submit refund, cancellation or rescheduling requests through:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@proxytechsupport.com">support@proxytechsupport.com</a>
        <br />
        <strong>Phone/WhatsApp:</strong> +91 96606 14469
      </p>
      <p>Include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full name</li>
        <li>Contact information</li>
        <li>Payment date</li>
        <li>Payment reference</li>
        <li>Service purchased</li>
        <li>Reason for the request</li>
        <li>Supporting screenshots or documents, where relevant</li>
        <li>Requested resolution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Requests sent through unrelated social-media comments may not contain enough information to be reviewed securely.</p>

      <h2>17. Review and Decision</h2>
      <p>We will review requests based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The agreed scope</li>
        <li>Written communications</li>
        <li>Work completed</li>
        <li>Time reserved</li>
        <li>Resources assigned</li>
        <li>Deliverables supplied</li>
        <li>Reason for cancellation</li>
        <li>Any service failure</li>
        <li>Applicable legal requirements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Approval or rejection will be communicated through an appropriate contact method.</p>
      <p>Any discretionary refund, credit or rescheduling offered in one case does not establish an obligation to provide the same outcome in another case.</p>

      <h2>18. Chargebacks</h2>
      <p>Customers should contact us first and allow a reasonable opportunity to review and resolve a genuine billing or delivery concern.</p>
      <p>Submitting a false, misleading or abusive chargeback after a service has been delivered may result in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suspension of further services</li>
        <li>Submission of service and communication records to the payment provider</li>
        <li>Recovery action where legally appropriate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nothing in this section prevents a customer from lawfully disputing an unauthorised transaction or pursuing a genuine legal remedy.</p>
