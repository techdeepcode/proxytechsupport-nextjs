      </p>

      <h2>6. Accuracy of Professional Information</h2>
      <p>Customers are solely responsible for ensuring that all information presented in their:</p>

        <li>CV</li>
        <li>Professional profile</li>
        <li>Job application</li>

        <li>Assessment</li>
        <li>Employer communication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>is accurate, truthful and supportable.</p>
      <p>
        We may help improve structure, clarity, presentation and relevance, but we do not authorise false
        claims or fabricated professional experience.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Fees and Payments</h2>
      <p>Applicable fees will normally be communicated before payment.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment is required before service scheduling or commencement</li>
        <li>Fees apply only to the agreed support service</li>
        <li>Payment does not purchase or guarantee an employment outcome</li>
        <li>Third-party payment charges, exchange-rate differences or banking fees may be borne by the customer</li>
        <li>Additional work outside the agreed scope may require additional payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A payment is considered accepted when it has been received and confirmed through the applicable payment channel.</p>

      <h2>8. Service Commencement and Resource Allocation</h2>
      <p>A service may be treated as commenced when any of the following occurs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A session is scheduled or reserved</li>
        <li>A team member is assigned</li>
        <li>Documents are reviewed</li>
        <li>Research or preparation begins</li>
        <li>A profile, plan, response or deliverable is prepared</li>
        <li>Technical work begins</li>
        <li>Interview or project requirements are analysed</li>
        <li>Support time is reserved</li>
        <li>Access to a support channel is provided</li>
        <li>Any agreed portion of the service is delivered</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because services require advance review, scheduling, specialist allocation and preparation,
        payments are generally non-refundable after acceptance or service commencement, subject to the
        Refund and Cancellation Policy and applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Scheduling and Rescheduling</h2>
      <p>Scheduling is subject to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Team availability</li>
        <li>Time-zone coordination</li>
        <li>Reasonable advance notice</li>
        <li>Receipt of the required information</li>
        <li>Payment confirmation</li>
        <li>The agreed service scope</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A rescheduling request should be submitted as early as reasonably possible.</p>
      <p>Approval of rescheduling is not guaranteed where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work has already begun</li>
        <li>A specialist has reserved time</li>
        <li>The request is made at the last minute</li>
        <li>The customer fails to attend</li>
        <li>Repeated schedule changes affect delivery</li>
        <li>The requested new time is unavailable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where practical, we may offer a rescheduled session or service credit at our discretion.</p>

      <h2>10. Missed Sessions and Customer Delays</h2>
      <p>A scheduled session may be treated as delivered where the customer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not attend</li>
        <li>Is materially late</li>
        <li>Is unavailable</li>
        <li>Does not provide required information</li>
        <li>Stops responding</li>
        <li>Cannot participate due to their own technical issue</li>
        <li>Cancels without reasonable notice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Customer delays do not automatically extend the agreed service period.</p>
      <p>Any extension, replacement session or credit is subject to availability and written approval.</p>

      <h2>11. Service Delivery</h2>
      <p>We will make reasonable efforts to deliver the agreed service professionally and within the communicated timeframe.</p>

        <li>Third-party outages</li>
        <li>Emergencies</li>
        <li>Events outside reasonable control</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where a material delay occurs, we will attempt to communicate an updated delivery plan.</p>

      <h2>12. No Professional Outcome Warranty</h2>
